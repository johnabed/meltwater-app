# CIA Document Processing

This web application was built by John Abed as part of the Meltwater software engineering assignment. The functionality of the app is:

  - Provide censor words and phrases (phrases in single/double quoted brackets) and words separated by spaces and commas
  - Input document text
  - Press "Process Document"
  - Magic - the Original and Processed versions of your document are displayed
  
## Angular CLI

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.9.
Change directory to client using `cd client` before running any further commands.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#### Thank you!
